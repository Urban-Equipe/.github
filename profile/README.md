### Repository structure

Typical repositories in this organization may include:

- **Platform projects**: deployments, configurations and customizations of participation platforms (e.g. Decidim instances)
- **Modules and plugins**: reusable components, integrations, or themes that can be shared with the broader community
- **Tools and scripts**: utilities that support participatory processes (e.g. data preparation, exports, reporting)

Not every repository will contain all of these elements, but most projects will follow these ideas and aim to be reusable by others.
